# SE102.3-Web
tourism website

index.html is the main file of the website. it also serves as the home page.

i have created and linked all the seven main pages.

every html page has 3 main "div". all the content is inside these three. first "div" contains all the navigation elements. last contains all the things related to footer. all the website content goes in the middle one ( second "div" )

if you need to add css please do so by creating a new css file or use inline css.

also there are couple of issues with the background image and the footer. they will be rectified and those issues should not affect the workflow.
