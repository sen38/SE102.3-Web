                                and is
                                covered by Montana
                                grassland and cloud forest. This plateau at an altitude of 2,100–2,300 metres
                                (6,900–7,500
                                ft) is rich in
                                biodiversity and many species found here are endemic to the region. This region was
                                designated a national park in 1988.
                                It is also a popular tourist destination.</li>
                            <li>The plains’ vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest, and includes many
                                endemic woody plants.
                                Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals,
                                and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri

                                and some studies
                                suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon. The sheer precipice of World’s End
